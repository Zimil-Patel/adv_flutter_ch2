## ✔️ 2.2.1 Cupertino Widgets (Plarform Conevrter using provider) [📂 (source)](https://github.com/Zimil-Patel/adv_flutter_ch2/tree/main/lib/platform%20converter)

### Knowledge

- In Flutter, __Cupertino widgets__ refer to a set of widgets designed to emulate the look and feel of iOS applications. These widgets follow the design language established by Apple for iOS apps, providing a consistent and familiar user experience for iOS users.

- Cupertino widgets offer UI components such as buttons, navigation bars, sliders, switches, and more, all styled according to iOS design principles. Developers can use these widgets to build cross-platform Flutter applications that closely resemble native iOS apps.

__Here are a few examples of Cupertino widgets in Flutter:__

1. __CupertinoActionSheet__ - Material equivalent => __showModalBottomSheet with ListView and ListTile widgets.__
2. __CupertinoActivityIndicator__ - Material equivalent => __CircularProgressIndicator.__
3. __CupertinoAlertDialog__ - Material equivalent => __AlertDialog.__
4. __CupertinoButton__ - Material equivalent => __ElevatedButton or TextButton.__
5. __CupertinoDatePicker__ - Material equivalent => __showDatePicker.__
6. __CupertinoTimerPicker__ - Material equivalent => __Custom implementation using showTimePicker.__
7. __CupertinoListTile__ - Material equivalent => __ListTile within a ListView.__
8. __CupertinoNavigationBar__ - Material equivalent => __AppBar.__

### Example (Flutter Adaptive UI Switcher)

- This Flutter app showcases the ability to seamlessly switch between Material Design and Cupertino Design UI platforms, providing users with a native experience tailored to their device. The app utilizes adaptive widgets and the Provider package for efficient state management.

### Features

1. __Adaptive Widgets__: The app leverages adaptive widgets to dynamically adjust the UI components based on the selected platform, ensuring a consistent and native user experience.
2. __Platform Switcher__: Users can effortlessly switch between Material Design and Cupertino Design UI platforms using a simple toggle switch.
3. __Provider Package Integration__: State management for the UI platform switching logic is handled efficiently with the Provider package, offering a clean and scalable solution.

## ✔️ 2.2.2 Platform class in Dart Flutter [📂 (source)](https://github.com/Zimil-Patel/adv_flutter_ch2/tree/main/lib/platform%20class%20example)

### Knowledge

- The '__Platform__' class in Dart Flutter provides information about the platform the app is currently running on, such as whether it's running on Android, iOS, or the web. This class is particularly useful when you need to write platform-specific code within your Flutter app.

### Example / Usage

```javascript
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Platform Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Running on: ${getPlatform()}',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20.0),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  String getPlatform() {
    if (Platform.isAndroid) {
      return 'Android';
    } else if (Platform.isIOS) {
      return 'iOS';
    } else if (Platform.isWindows) {
      return 'Windows';
    } else if (Platform.isMacOS) {
      return 'macOS';
    } else if (Platform.isLinux) {
      return 'Linux';
    } else if (Platform.isFuchsia) {
      return 'Fuchsia';
    } else {
      return 'Unknown';
    }
  }
}

```

### Explanation

- The Platform class is imported from package:flutter/services.dart.
- In the example, we have a simple Flutter app with a single screen (MyApp), which displays the platform the app is running on.
- The getPlatform() function checks the current platform using static boolean properties like isAndroid, isIOS, etc., provided by the Platform class.
- Depending on the platform, it returns a string indicating the platform name.
- This information can be useful for writing platform-specific code within your Flutter app.
